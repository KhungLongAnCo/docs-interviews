# Common Question

1. **Intro myself**

    My name is Luan.My full name is Nguyen Van Luan. You can call me Levi that is my english name. I'm 23 years olds.
    Since 4 years I'm working as full stack developer But almost time I worked on Front-end side. For my tech stack details:
    - In Front-end: I'm working with javascript and some library related it like react js, next js and angular but about angular I worked it 2 years ago so it angular 5 and i think it is old knowledge. ...
    - In Back-end: I'm working with node js and next js framework, nest js. java but java is long time ago...
    - About Database: I'm working on postgresql, SQL, mongodb
    - About Working environment: I'm working with Agile and Scum.

2. **Differences between Framework and Library**
    - Framework is a platforms used for building and deploying an application quickly. Frameworks combine resources like images, docs into packages. With Framework we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience.
    - A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks.

3. **Differences between Agile and Waterfall**
    Agile and Waterfall are two different project management methodologies used in software development. Here are some of the key differences between Agile and Waterfall:
    - **Approach**: Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next phase. Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, where the project is broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks that are completed in short iterations.
    - **Flexibility**: Waterfall is a rigid methodology that does not allow for much flexibility or changes once the project has started. Agile, on the other hand, is a flexible methodology that allows for changes and adjustments to be made throughout the project.
    - **Requirements**: Waterfall requires that all requirements be defined upfront before the project starts, while Agile allows for requirements to be defined and refined throughout the project.
    - Testing: Waterfall typically has a separate testing phase at the end of the project, while Agile incorporates testing throughout the project in each iteration.
    - **Communication**: Waterfall relies heavily on documentation and formal communication, while Agile emphasizes face-to-face communication and collaboration between team members.
    - **Timeframe**: Waterfall projects typically have a longer timeframe, while Agile projects are completed in shorter iterations.
    - **Risk**: Waterfall projects have a higher risk of failure due to the lack of flexibility and the possibility of requirements changing, while Agile projects have a lower risk of failure due to the iterative and incremental approach.

    In summary, Waterfall is a more traditional and rigid approach to software development, while Agile is a more flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between team members.
