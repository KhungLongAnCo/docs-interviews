# Common Question

1. **Intro myself**

    My name is Luan.My full name is Nguyen Van Luan. You can call me Levi that is my english name. I'm 23 years olds.
    Since 4 years I'm working as full stack developer But almost time I worked on Front-end side. For my tech stack details:
    - In Front-end: I'm working with javascript and some library related it like react js, next js and angular but about angular I worked it 2 years ago so it angular 5 and i think it is old knowledge. ...
    - In Back-end: I'm working with node js and next js framework, nest js. java but java is long time ago...
    - About Database: I'm working on postgresql, SQL, mongodb
    - About Working environment: I'm working with Agile and Scum.

2. **Differences between Framework and Library**
    - Framework is a platforms used for building and deploying an application quickly. Frameworks combine resources like images, docs into packages. With Framework we can use resources to facilitate faster development and a greater user experience.
    - A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks.

3. **Differences between Agile and Waterfall**
    Agile and Waterfall are two different project management methodologies used in software development. Here are some of the key differences between Agile and Waterfall:
    - **Approach**: Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase of the project is completed before moving on to the next phase. Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, where the project is broken down into smaller, more manageable chunks that are completed in short iterations.
    - **Flexibility**: Waterfall is a rigid methodology that does not allow for much flexibility or changes once the project has started. Agile, on the other hand, is a flexible methodology that allows for changes and adjustments to be made throughout the project.
    - **Requirements**: Waterfall requires that all requirements be defined upfront before the project starts, while Agile allows for requirements to be defined and refined throughout the project.
    - Testing: Waterfall typically has a separate testing phase at the end of the project, while Agile incorporates testing throughout the project in each iteration.
    - **Communication**: Waterfall relies heavily on documentation and formal communication, while Agile emphasizes face-to-face communication and collaboration between team members.
    - **Timeframe**: Waterfall projects typically have a longer timeframe, while Agile projects are completed in shorter iterations.
    - **Risk**: Waterfall projects have a higher risk of failure due to the lack of flexibility and the possibility of requirements changing, while Agile projects have a lower risk of failure due to the iterative and incremental approach.

    In summary, Waterfall is a more traditional and rigid approach to software development, while Agile is a more flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between team members.

4. **Differences between Client site and Server site rendering**

    Client-side rendering refers to the process of rendering a web page on the client's browser using JavaScript. The server sends the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client, and the client's browser renders the page based on the instructions in the JavaScript code. This approach allows for faster page load times and a more interactive user experience.

    Server-side rendering, on the other hand, refers to the process of rendering a web page on the server before sending it to the client. The server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and sends them to the client as a complete web page. This approach is useful for improving search engine optimization (SEO) and ensuring that the page is accessible to users who have disabled JavaScript in their browsers.

    The main differences between client-side and server-side rendering are:

    - **Performance**: Client-side rendering can be faster because the browser can cache the JavaScript files and only request new data from the server when necessary. Server-side rendering can be slower because the server has to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for each request.

    - **SEO**: Server-side rendering is better for SEO because search engines can crawl the HTML content of the page. Client-side rendering can make it difficult for search engines to index the page because the content is generated dynamically.

    - **Accessibility**: Server-side rendering ensures that the page is accessible to users who have disabled JavaScript in their browsers. Client-side rendering may not work for users who have disabled JavaScript or are using older browsers.

    - **Interactivity**: Client-side rendering allows for more interactivity because the JavaScript code can update the page without requiring a full page refresh. Server-side rendering may require a full page refresh to update the content.
